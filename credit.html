</a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Neil Gogte <br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> Some of my
seniors were taught Oracle Apps by him around year 2001. At that time
people in Hyd were not aware of Apps.&nbsp; Afterwards&nbsp; he
got busy with Leapstone and was not into teaching anymore. Most people
know only this much about him.<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">( Even now some people think 11i is
next
version of database 8i 9i 10g and after that&nbsp; 11i. However 11i is
in fact a seperate line of product to facilitate E Business instead of
just a&nbsp; technology component like Oracle Database versions like 8i
9i and 10g).
<br>
</span>
<p>Well ..back to Neil Sir, at&nbsp; present (present as in&nbsp; Oct
2005).&nbsp;
He is two timing himself in setting up a Center&nbsp; for LeapStone and
taking&nbsp; classes for Java.
Core + Advanced+ J2EE.&nbsp; His makeshift site for Genesis
is <a href="http://www.geocities.com/online_genesis">here.</a>

<b>Eric S Raymond </b><br>
You should read his book <a
 href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cathbazpaper/">Cathedral and the
Bazaar</a>. His site is <a href="http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/">here.</a>&nbsp;
He has a clear
conscience and a in the face way of saying things.&nbsp; Wish to meet
him sometime in Person<br>
.
Last updated Date for webpages is one of the smart ideas that I have
also used in my website(using JS it picks the timestamp of the file to
show in HTML page ). Check out his link for <a
 href="http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/faqs/Fedora-Core-on-Thinkpad-X40/">using
Fedora on
IBM X40laptop</a> . Hopefully I will get
my X40 soon thanks to IBM-Lenovo deal to bring cost down.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never met him&nbsp; but&nbsp; actively looking
forward to meet him.

<b>Keith Swartz
&nbsp;</b><br>
The style of writing in <a href="http://www.oneroad.com">www.oneroad.com</a>
website is very natural and friendly. I have had the privilege of
working with him. A stickler for following standards. He is the one
who introduced me to the w3c community and standards. Which I try my
best to follow. He is an MIT graduate.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have had the privilege of working with him for
2 years (2003-2005) in <a href="www.oracle.com">Oracle</a><br>
<br>
<b>Roger Sanders</b><br>
He prepared the Techstack Perl Base modules using&nbsp; OOPS way of
doing Perl&nbsp; (I think this is not easy esp as it is so easy to fall
back to procedural based programming in perl).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can not say he liked me a lot.&nbsp; But
what
the heck, I know he is a great guy&nbsp; and I still use his Perl
Modules.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have had the privilege of working with him for 2
years (2003-2005) in <a href="www.oracle.com">Oracle</a> <br>

</b><b>Jerry (Ravi Jerome Barnes )</b><br>
A 7 footer, best mix of management and technology. Be it board room
disscussions , Server Rooms (networks ), Table tennis this guy has been
a champ all along.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have had the privilege of working with him for 2
years&nbsp; (2001-2003) in <a href="www.nucleussoftware.com">Nucleus
Software Exports.</a><br>
At present he&nbsp; is in Japan married to a beautiful Girl<br>
<br>
<b>
Sanjay Kumar</b><br>
He is the one who introduced me to the technology as a tool instead of
some piece of code that does fancy things. My initial years, I was
wandering in technology forest holding his hand.<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarded for his immense knowlegde for latest
technologies. We worked on Oracle 9i Application server and Forms
Listener Servlet that was recently introduced some time in 2001.<br>
People who work under him for a long time, usaually develop a liking
towards technology (Oracle in general)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is what I would say is a Diamond cutter(India can
boast of Diamond cutters ;) ). If you can not stand his razor sharp
training He will simply throw you back to the heap of pebbles, he
picked you from.</p>
