<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What do you want to do with your
life.</span>I want to visit France and live for some time ( more then 6
months ) in the Art Capital of the world -Paris. </p>
<p>I want to own a flat in Lokhandwala Mumbai.</p>
<p>I want to be a Multilingual TechnoFunctional Consultant Working as a
bridge between Chinese Small time firms and Indian Big Time Corporates.</p>
<p>I want to retire at the age of 40.</p>
<p>(Does it sounds Ambitious, NaaaaH !!!!!! ) More about me
<a href="ToDo.html">here</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why do you write/document so much. </span>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I write for myself.&nbsp; It keeps me in sync with where I
want to go and what I am doing to go there. It also serves as an
excellent&nbsp; reference for past experiences. I have a very short
memory you see.&nbsp; All RAM no Hard Disk.&nbsp; ;-) </p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What was your education like<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>
</span>I am a proud product of Devi Ahilya University.&nbsp; It was in
this university that I did my Graduation in Mechanical Engineering (<a
 href="http://www.sgsits.ac.in/">S G S I T S </a>). In 2002 my alma
Mater completed its <a href="http://www.sgsits.ac.in/jubilee.htm">Golden
Jublee</a>.We had the privilege of having the President of India Mr APJ
ABul kalam Azad as a chief guest (Two of his excellent books are
Ignited Minds and Wings of Fire. THose who do not know he was the chief
architect behind making india a Nucleur Power not as a politician but
as a Scientist- Man I am proud of having him with us )&nbsp; After one
year of job returned to do my Masters in Information systems.&nbsp; (<a
 href="http://iips.edu/">IIPS</a>)&nbsp; I must frankly admit that I
was never a topper. Just managed to get .. average grades&nbsp; all the
&nbsp; time.
<br />
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What you do in your free time </span>These
days,&nbsp; I just sleep.&nbsp; (There used to be a time when I was
sketching, wandering, watching the night sky , and playing flute. I
still do all these things .. but in my sleep. ;-D) <br />
</p>
<p><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Your resume. </span><br />
It is <a href="resume.html">here</a>.&nbsp; <br />

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Here are a couple of canned bios of
varying length and seriousness that you

  </li>
  <li>

backgrounds. Sometimes he writes software code to make a
living.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
