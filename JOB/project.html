<p><a href="project_perl.html">Project Java</a> (Year 2001 -present)</p>
<p>Java Is not what it was 4 years back..&nbsp; when I was&nbsp; doing
my MMS from IIPS. It has had developed a lot .. and is today a language
of choice. <br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really liked one particular feature of Java
as Mentioned in Ed Romans book on Mastering EJBs *****&nbsp; OOPS
brings concept of software components. Components that solve a
particular kind of problem can be purchased and can be combined with
other components to solve large problems.&nbsp; A little technically it
means <br style="font-style: italic;"></br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Java supports
interface/implementation seperation at syntactic level (class keyword
and interface keyword). We can vary a programs proprietery logic
without changing any clients code. At compile time .. implementation is
not needed only an interface is needed. Adding to it the cross platform
language It becomes an ideal choice to base your components on. </span><br></br>
</p>
<hr></hr><a href="project_perl.html">Project Perl</a> (Year 2004 -present)
<p>Sojourn to understand one of the most helpful language. The best
part (or may be worst ) about Perl is that it Does something all the
time.. as if it is having a mind of its own. You just need to know this
beast well before you can tame it. Once you have done this It has
served as an excellent workhorse which gets 99% of the things done in a
jiffy.</p>

<p><a href="oracle11iEbusiness_Suite.html">Oracle 11i E-Business suite </a>
(Year 2003-present ) </p>
<p>Oracle 11i is a collection of around 220 software products ranging
from age old business enabling softwares as Financials and
Manufacturing to businesses as new as Online Student System. All these
220 + products run using technologies that have become standard. All
these technologies provide a stage for these 220 products to deliver
the latest and greatest to oracle customers. We in Application
Technology Group update\support\maintain this techstack </p>

<p><a href="link.html">Brain Fodder</a> </p>
<p>Well this is not really a project .. but an ongoing effort to keep
all the relevent links. That have been doing rounds since quite some
time. and I have found them to be of immense value. It might also just
contain the Bookmarks that I have </p>

<p><a href="oracle9i_application_server.html">Oracle 9iApplication
Server</a> (Year 2002-2003) </p>
<p>Oracle had released a new version of Application server Just around
the time when I joined Nucleus Software Exports New Delhi. My most
important work was to implement the Forms Listener Servlet Architecture
on Oracle 9i Application server when it was still in its nascent stage.</p>

While doing my MMS from IIPS myself with sniors&nbsp; started a
newsletter for the Institute. Next year we started an e -edition of
this newsletter &nbsp;with my juniors. &nbsp; All money was generated
through advertisements and no help was taken from the Institute.Sheer
fun working together with people from as different streams ( <a
 href="http://www.liips.20m.com/aboutliips.htm">Advertising, Tourism,
Commerce, Biotechnology</a>). I had also designed the official mascot
for our newletter which we called&nbsp; as <b>Liiper</b>. I still draw
my inspiration from my this episode of life. There were life&nbsp; <a
 href="Bad_decisions_in_Liips.html">lessons </a>which can never be
learned in a class. <br></br>
